The folder contains both code for visualisation and triangulation

Visualisation:
* Scenario.pde is the visualisation code
* data.txt and guards.txt are the files to put coordinates for visualisation


Triangulation:
* Use the makefile to compile the C program(triangulation) automatically, and run the program with the command ./triangulate data_1 
* Put the vertex for the polygon in file called data_1
* The program will output the vertex for each triangle numbered in the file data_1
